 Write BFS and DFS in c . Learn about their Applications 

 Breadth First search :- 

 It is one of the important and useful data structures :)


 DFS :
 requires a stack. You will have a graph 
 start with some vertex and put it visited=1 , if it is visited.
 Take vertex that is top on the stack and see which is not visited. repeat the above steps.

 BFS :
 use of different supporting data structure. 
 We will use a queue here.
 Put the first vertex in a queue and dequeue it and try to get all the adjacent vertices. 
 Repeat the steps as stated above. We will get a tree from breadth first search.
